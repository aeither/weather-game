## Motivation

Building a decentralized betting game that relies on real-world events can be a challenging task. However, with the power of Web3 functions, this process becomes much easier. By leveraging the ability to call any type of API and trigger on-chain functions, developers can create seamless and engaging user experiences that integrate with the real world.

## Further Exploration

This project can serve as a solid foundation for your own Web3 project. With gasless onboarding and Web3 functions already integrated, the possibilities are endless. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

- Create an option market
- Develop a lottery system
- Build a sports betting platform

Let your imagination run wild and use this project as a starting point to bring your Web3 ideas to life!
